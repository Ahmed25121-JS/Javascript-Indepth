    // Important:

    // Each element itself is a nodelist. Each element has all the values (from ariatext to id,classes etc
    //)these values are just not set
    // a nodelist is in simple terms are values that a element has by default
    // these values can be either set or not set by us but each element still has a nodelist
    // child elements are also counted as nodelist values
    // this complex structure of individual nodelists and child elemests as nodelist items(each child element has a nodelist itself)
    //  makes a complex tree like structure of javascript

   const div = document.createElement('div')
   console.log(div);
   div.className ='main'
   div.id=Math.floor(Math.random()* 10 +1)  
   div.setAttribute('title','generated title')
   div.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'
//    div.innerHTML= "chai aur code"
            //  OR 
const addText = document.createTextNode('chai aur code')
div.appendChild(addText)
document.body.appendChild(div)
//    The div created is in memory first we have to tell the DOM to attach it to itself
// when we are creating new elements  we should try to use div.classname,div.innerhtml less because
// the class or innerhtml or id is fetched first than  it is set then it is returned
// so this makes 2 round trips 
// we should try to use methods like set attribute/createtextnode more as this saves one round trip
