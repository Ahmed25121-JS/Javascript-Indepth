// In DOM
// our html is our document
// it is made up of elements (e.g div,h1 etc). Each element here is a object itself
// Model here means the structure of our webpage meaning head tag is one child and body tag is one child
// which are further divided into more childs some may have siblings



// first comes window object which inside it has our document of html(here html document itself is an object ) 
// and is made up elements(e.g div,h1,p,span etc) which are objects themselves 
// Each element can be called a node
// each element has attributes like href,class,id etc
