// Javascript Execution Context => How javascript will run/execute a file

// When Javascript file is executed first global execution context(which is an object) will be made which is stored in THIS

// Functional execution Context

// Eval execution context



// javascript code is executed in two phases
// 1. Memory creation phase/Creation Phase => This is known as first cycle
// Memory is allocated to variables





// 2.Execution Phase   This is known as second cycle
// Functions are executed


// For every function execution new environment is created memory phase and execution phase is done and then value is returned
// to global context and then this new environment is deleted



// Call Stack
// Functions go into global execution context and come out on the basis of
// First in last out meaning that is there are 2 functions within a function 
// then the last one to go in will be the first to come out (meanig the thrid function will come out first)
