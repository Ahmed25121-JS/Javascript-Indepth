// Default:
// synchronous
// single threaded - means code will be executed in a single thread. it doesnt let us feel that its slow because it
// uses the help of runtime environment with its own execution engine to execute code

// Blocking Code(synchronous code) 
// stops code from going forward while file is being read or data is being fetched

// Non-Default
// Non- Blocking Code(asynchronous code) 
// does not stop code from going forward while file is being read or data is being fetched
// Notifies the code after the file has been read
